Generating Cultures
===================

-	Individuals have `motivations`
	-	e.g. ethics, valued work/jobs, personal preferences, views of role of gov't?
-	Things that should be queryable:
	-	Democracy vs Republic vs Elected Executive vs Council of Families vs Dictator etc
	-	Nuclear Family vs Multiple generations living together vs communal living vs solitary living
	-	trust for outsiders
	-	tolerance for dissent
	-	"CLA <-> CSE axis" -- subset of "valued work/jobs" ?
	-	Value of personal privacy (both physical and mental)
	-	Right to not self-incriminate?
	-	who sets penalties for crimes?
	-	who chooses what is crime?
	-	what "private decisions" does the gov't get to make?
	-	what "private decisions" does the gov't get to veto?
